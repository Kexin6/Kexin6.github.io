            I joined Professor Qi Li’s group at Tsinghua University in May 2021.
            Since then, I have been working on secure machine learning: highly-functional DNN model IP protection.
            We are currently writing a paper that will be submitted to the 31st USENIX Security Symposium conference (USENIX Security '22) this October.

            I was involved in developing High-Level Synthesis tool chain for Intel FPGA, including OneAPI, High-Level Synthesis (HLS) compiler, and OpenCL.
            This experience requires the knowledge of C++, compiler basics (frontend to backend), algorithms, debugging and communication skills.
            Having worked actively with customers and engineers at global sites, I developed strong communication skills and self-efficacy.
            Due to my proficiency in team working, I was able to build a trusting relationship with my co-workers and took responsibility of critical tasks
            such as weekly performance monitoring and design updates.

            I was the summer research intern in the Programmable Digital Systems Group at the University of Toronto. I worked on the research, design, implementation and test of the proposed research.
            This involves knowledge of software engineering, algorithms, data structures and computer hardware.
            I met weekly with the supervisor (Professor Jason Anderson) one-on-one, as well as joining the weekly meetings with his graduate students.
            I co-authored and published my research work in 2019. (Details see the Publication page)

            My job was mainly testing and improving the program. I helped debug and run the program to see whether there were any potential improvements to make or errors to fix.
            During this working period, I participated in all the discussions and mostly all the meetings in our department to follow up with the process of a project.
            This experience helped me to have a basic understanding of the idea of MVC. I also got to know the general steps of implementation,
            since I was in charge of debugging and testing. Apart from these, my supervisor taught me the basic structure of the software system.
            Due to this job, I learnt how to program using Java. Under the help of my supervisor, I also practiced coding using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to design a web page.
